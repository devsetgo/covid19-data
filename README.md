# Covid19 Analysis
This is not meant to be imperical data, just me trying to keep my sanity and track if it is getting worse or better.

# Datasets Used
NYTimes Data - https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data
World Data - https://github.com/datasets/covid-19

County, State, and World Population from US Census data and Wikipedia. So take it as a grain of salt for 2020 Population estimates.
